# Front End Web Development Techdegree - Project 2

I am attempting to meet the "Exceeds Expectations" requirements for this project:

- Project files placed in GitHub repository.

- Project includes index.html:
  - The HTML file includes the viewport meta tag in the head of the document.
  - A Google Font is being used for the text.
  - The navigation menu items have working links to the different sections that use IDâ€™s to link to relevant anchor tags.
  - The <nav> tag is being used for the navigation bar.
  - Additional section (Skills section) has been added to the page and a working link to the new section has been added to the navigation bar using an ID to link to anchor tag.

- Project contains a stylesheet (styles.css) inside of a CSS folder.
  - A mobile-first approach is utilized using min-width properties for media queries (tablets at 768px, and desktop screens at 1024px).
  - General spacing and arrangement of the elements matches the design of the mockups for Mobile, Tablet, Desktop.
  - The following additional styling enhancements have been added to the portfolio: 1) a new background color or image for the navigation and/or main sections of the site; 2) the color of at least one piece of text has been changed; 3) one additional Google font has been added, and is being used on the page; 4) additional styling for links has been added.

Validation:
  - HTML validated for index.html with accepted exceptions.
  - CSS validated for styles.css with accepted exceptions.
  - I checked the pages in Opera, Chrome, and Firefox - everything appears to work.
